Items should be presented in an order

Above code works but the Rails community has agreed upon certain order in which items should be presented. And the order goes something like this:

-  default_scope
-  constants
-  attr_*
-  enum
-  associations
-  validations
-  callbacks
-  other macros (like devise's, has_secure_password) should be placed after the callbacks
-  public methods
-  private methods
