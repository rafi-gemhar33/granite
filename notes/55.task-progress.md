```ruby
  respond_with_success(t("successfully_updated", entity: "Task")) unless params.key?(:quiet)
```


So far we have been using the as_json method to load the association data. The problem with using as_json to load assigned_user here is that for each pending_task a new query will be sent to the database to load its associated assigned_user.

This is called an n+1 query issue where n number of additional queries are made to fetch some data that could be fetched in one query. To learn more about the n+1 query issue and how to avoid it you can refer to the in-depth n+1 queries and memoization chapter.

We can avoid n+1 queries by using the includes method to fetch the assigned_user like so:

```ruby
  @pending_tasks = tasks.pending.includes(:assigned_user)
```

### Partials in Jbuilder
- touch app/views/tasks/_task.json.jbuilder

```ruby

json.id task.id
json.title task.title
json.slug task.slug
json.assigned_user do
  json.extract! task.assigned_user,
    :id,
    :name
end

  json.partial! "tasks/task", task: @task
```
