### LOGOUT

```
delete axios.defaults.headers["X-Auth-Email"];
delete axios.defaults.headers["X-Auth-Token"];
setToLocalStorage({
        authToken: null,
        email: null,
        userId: null,
        userName: null,
      });

#   @current_user = nil
```

### CREATOR

```
  #migration
    add_column :tasks, :task_owner_id, :integer
    add_foreign_key :tasks, :users, column: :task_owner_id, on_delete: :cascade
  #user
    has_many :created_tasks, foreign_key: :task_owner_id, class_name: "Task"
  #task
    belongs_to :task_owner, class_name: "User", foreign_key: "task_owner_id"

```

The on_delete: :cascade option makes sure that the referencing rows, which here
are the rows of the task table, also get deleted when deleting the rows of the
referenced table, which is the user table in this case.
