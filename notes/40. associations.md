### belongs_to association

```
class Student
  belongs_to :group
end
# =================
class CreateResults < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :students do |t|
      t.references :group, null: false, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end

end
```

### options to the belongs_to association.

```
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :cohort, class_name: "Group"
end
#   belongs_to :cohort, class_name: "Group", foreign_key: "group_id"
#   belongs_to :group, primary_key :g_id
#   belongs_to :group, optional: true
#   polymorphic: Passing true to the :polymorphic
```

### has_one :final_result, class_name: "Result"

- class_name This option is used to specify the name of the model class when it
  cannot be inferred from the association name
- primary_key
- foreign_key
- dependent
  - dependent: :destroy causes the associated object to also be destroyed.
  - dependent: :delete causes the associated object to be deleted directly from
    the database (so callbacks will not execute).
  - dependent: :nullify causes the foreign key to be set to NULL. Callbacks are
    not executed.
  - dependent: :restrict_with_exception causes an exception to be raised if
    there is an associated record.
  - dependent: :restrict_with_error causes an error to be added to the owner if
    there is an associated object.
- as: Setting the :as option indicates that this is a polymorphic association.
  Polymorphic associations are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
- through: The :through option specifies a join model through which to perform
  the query. We will learn more about this option in the has_one :through
  associations which we have discussed in detail later in this chapter.

### has_many association
class CreateProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :projects do |t|
      t.references :student, null: false, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

```

- class_name This option is used to specify the name of the model class when it
  cannot be inferred from the association name
- primary_key By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the
  primary key of a model is id.
- foreign_key By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the
  foreign key on the other model is the name of this model with the suffix \_id
  added.
- dependent
  - dependent: :destroy causes the associated object to also be destroyed.
  - dependent: :delete_all causes the associated object to be deleted directly
    from the database (so callbacks will not execute).
  - dependent: :nullify causes the foreign key to be set to NULL. Callbacks are
    not executed.
  - dependent: :restrict_with_exception causes an exception to be raised if
    there is an associated record.
  - dependent: :restrict_with_error causes an error to be added to the owner if
    there is an associated object.
- as: Setting the :as option indicates that this is a polymorphic association.
  Polymorphic associations are discussed in detail later in this chapter.
- through: The :through option specifies a join model through which to perform
  the query. We will learn more about this option in the has_one :through
  associations which we have discussed in detail later in this chapter.
