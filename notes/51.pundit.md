## TaskPolicy

```ruby
  include Pundit::Authorization

  #===================
  class TaskPolicy
  attr_reader :user, :task

  def initialize(user, task)
    @user = user
    @task = task
  end

  def show?
    # some condition which returns a boolean value
  end

  #===========
  authorize @task

  #===========
  rescue_from Pundit::NotAuthorizedError, with: :handle_authorization_error
end

```

- The second argument is that of a model object, whose authorization you want to
  check.
- The class implements some kind of query method, in this case show?. Usually,
  this will map to the name of a particular controller action.

## policy scope

```ruby

  class Scope
    attr_reader :user, :scope

    def initialize(user, scope)
      @user = user
      @scope = scope
    end

    def resolve
      scope.where(task_owner_id: user.id).or(scope.where(assigned_user_id: user.id))
    end
  end

    # index
    tasks = TaskPolicy::Scope.new(current_user, Task).resolve
    policy_scope(Task)

# security for fail-fast way, Pundit provides us some helper methods
  after_action :verify_authorized, except: :index
  after_action :verify_policy_scoped, only: :index

```
