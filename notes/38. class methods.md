```
class ClassName
  def self.class_method_name
    # some code
  end
end
#====
class ClassName
  class << self
    def class_method_name
      # some code
    end
  end
end

```

Every scope takes two arguments:

- A name, which we can use to call this scope in our code.
- A lambda function, which implements the query.

```
class Fruit < ApplicationRecord
  scope :with_juice, -> { where("juice > 0") }
end
```
